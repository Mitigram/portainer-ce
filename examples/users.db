# Files modelled after this one can be used to create users and associate them
# to teams. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash-mark will be ignored.
# Otherwise lines should contain a number of colon-separated fields. In order:
# - The name of the user to create
# - The password of the user, when the letter x, a password will be generated
#   and logged.
# - The role id of the user: 1 (admin) or 2 (regular user)
# - The list of teams that this user belongs to, separated by commas. Teams that
#   do not exist yet will be created.
# The file must end with an empty line.
